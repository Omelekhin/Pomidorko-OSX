# Pomidorko OS X

So bla-bla-bla, ok, so here's the plan...

# :bird: :boom: :fire: THE FUCKING PLAN :us: :boom: :bird:

So, we have following shit done:

1. About ~~page~~ window UI
2. Timer UI 
3. Timer logic
4. Motherfucking hovering
5. Ticking and sound notification
6. The shit in the right corner
7. Saving progress to the disk

We need to make up this shit before December the 20th:

1. Reset progress at early morning
2. Settings window
3. Fade from dock

That's all the shit needed to be implemented

P.S.: I love writing README's files in `vim`, it's very fun, ha-ha-ha
