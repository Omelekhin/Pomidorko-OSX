# Pomidorko OS X

So bla-bla-bla, ok, so here's the plan...

# :bird: :boom: :fire: THE FUCKING PLAN :us: :boom: :bird:

So, we have following shit done:

1. About ~~page~~ window UI
2. Timer UI 
3. Timer logic
4. Motherfucking hovering
5. Ticking and sound notification
6. The shit in the right corner
7. Saving progress to the disk
8. Fade from dock
9. Reset progress at early morning
10. Settings window
11. Show menu while dock icon is hidden

We need to make up this shit before December the 25th:

1. Change font 300 to goals
2. Try Fn + Cmd + F8 shortcut
3. Tab circulation for subviews in settings
4. Settings enter key for inputs

That's all the shit needed to be implemented

P.S.: I love writing README's files in `vim`, it's very fun, ha-ha-ha
