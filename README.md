# Pomidorko OS X

So bla-bla-bla, ok, so here's the plan...

# :bird: :boom: :fire: THE FUCKING PLAN :us: :boom: :bird:

So, we have following shit done:

1. About ~~page~~ window UI
2. Timer UI 
3. Timer logic
4. Motherfucking hovering

We need to make up this shit before December the 20th:

1. The shit in the right corner
2. Saving progress to the disk
3. Reset progress at early summer
4. Settings window
5. Ticking and sound notification
6. Fade from dock

That's all the shit needed to be implemented

P.S.: I love writing README's files in `vim`, it's very fun, ha-ha-ha
